# Fundamentals 2

## Git 
Git checkout changes branches on your machine -\> important that you then 
Git pull then pulls the changes that have been made
Git branch -a shows all branches
When committing, it is better for commit messages to be whole rather than explicit
Once you have merged the branches, you have only merged this locally. You need to push it to the remote repository.

If someone has made changes to the master branch, and youâ€™re working on a feature branch, you need to merge the master branch first so you are up to date and then merge the feature branch.

## Coding Standards
Creating packages uses canonical format 
Classes use _PascalCase_
{} braces
() parenthesis 
`[]` Square brackets

### Styling
Some orgs use styling files & styling references specific to them.

## Java 
`// /* /**`
Different comment types
Max length should be 80 characters wide
`public static void main(String[] args)` - shortcut *psvm*
`System.out.println();` prints line to the terminal - shortcut *sout
